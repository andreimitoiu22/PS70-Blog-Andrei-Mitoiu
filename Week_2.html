  #Laser Cutter

  In the first session of the week, we learned about laser cutting, for which we were recommended to use the Fusion 360 program. Learning the program was not easy, and it was a bit of a learning curve. We then were shown how to use the laser cutter, which seemed straightforward enough.
  During the lab session, I had to tackle an assignment that used both the program and the laser cutter. I had to “create a press-fit construction kit that can be assembled in multiple ways, and accounts for laser cutter kerf”. I decided to use a round triangle, and after a couple of tries, I was able to get the result below. I took into account the board thickness and kerf using the “user parameters” feature. The thickness of the board turned out to be 4.5 mm and the kerf around 0.65 mm. Using them as variables allowed me to change them easily - which impacts the overall shape automatically.

  I then extruded them, and used the “project” function to create a DXF file. I then used the DXF file, imported it in the laser cutter program and cut the shape out of cardboard.
  After a couple attempts, I was able to get a couple triangles that fit together perfectly (as seen below).

  #Vinyl Cutter
  We were also assigned to use a Vinyl Cutter, for which a bitmap file is needed. Therefore, because I had some knowledge in photoshop, I took the picture I liked and turned it into a bitmap png. I used techniques such as gaussian blur, threshold, black and white, curves to achieve this image.

  In the end, I placed it in the Vinyl Cutter program, and decided to cut it out of black sticker paper. I also had to make sure my image size did not surpass the size of the sticker paper. Getting the sticker off the paper proved to be difficult, but I was eventually able to place it on a paper using transfer tape.

  #Electronics 
  
  In the second part of the week, we learned a little about basic electronics. We started by using an Arduino as a power source for a breadboard in which we placed wires, resistors, variable resistors and buttons to control a lightbulb. We also used a voltage meter to measure the voltage drop-off after a resistor, and used Ohm’s law to calculate the current (when we knew the initial voltage was 5V and the resistance was 1000 Omes). The drop-of shown by the voltage meter was of 2.4 Volts, so the current turned out to be 2.4 V / 1000 ohms = 0.0024 amps.

  #3D modeling
  
  For our next assignment, we had to create two 3D models of real-world objects that could be assembled together effectively. What was important however, was that the dimensions are accurate to the real world. I decided to model and assemble a power socket and an outlet. So I used a caliper to measure the real-life objects as references, and took photos of my measurements for later use (what can be seen below are only a couple of the photos I took).

  The [tutorials](https://help.autodesk.com/view/fusion360/ENU/courses/AP-GET-STARTED-OVERVIEW) that were assigned as viewings proved to be very helpful when modeling, as I understood how to use tools such as sketching, extruding, assembling using joints, filet and creation of objects.

  </div> 
  
  While these techniques are still only basics, they allowed me to create both models and  assemble them together effectively (as seen below).
