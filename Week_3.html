#This week's assignment

This week, I was asked to create a system out of cardboard or other materials that translates the movement of a motor into a kinetic sculpture. So, after a bit of planning, I decided to do a ”whack a mole” inspired moving sculpture, in which 4 moles would come out of the ground and then back down continuously.
I took inspiration from [Sophie's flock of birds](https://sophiecwebster.github.io/PHYSCI-70/03_kinetic/index.html), in which she uses precisely bent wires to translate the motor motion into bird movements. Unfortunately, I knew I couldn't imitate the randomness, so I wanted to just have 4 moles come up and down one after the other. I knew I would mainly use laser-cut wood (for the gears) and cardboard in this project. As I wanted 4 moles, I knew I had to create a gear system that would translate the movement from one motor to two other rotating axes. As it can be seen below, this was the first test of gears using cardboard as a material (I used a fusion 360 plugin and [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZakT54JIhB8) to create the gears). They were getting stuck from time to time, which was mainly because of the soft properties of the cardboard, so I knew I had to remake them with wood. This took a couple of tries, but in the end I was able to get the perfect gears working (the second photo below shows all unused gears and materials in the project).

Secondly, I also created the box where the gears and other mechanisms would move in Fusion 360, and then laser-cutted it. I used hot glue to bind them together.

I then created a mole model in photoshop and exported it as an SVG file so the laser cutter knows which lines to cut, and which ones to only burn (the ones making up the eyes, mouth and belly of the animals would only be burnt in the cardboard). I made sure they were also the right size and could fit through the openings I made in the cardboard box.

After a lot of work, I realized that the wire-based system I envisioned would not work consistently, so I decided to instead modify my build by using circular cylinders attached at a decentral point to a wood stick. This would cause a platform staging on the sideways cylinder to rise whenever the wooden stick was turned. The platform itself was relatively straightforward, but took a lot of work. I had two sticks attached to the moles that were on the other end attached to a small cross that was pushed by the cylinders. Unfortunately, when I tried to attach the motor, against my many efforts, the motor seemed unable to rotate the middle gear without detaching itself from the stick that was meant to be rotated. I think the lack of resistance coming from the cardboard fixtures (that connected the motor and the stick) and the speed of the motor were the main failures of this project.

However, I was still able to move the device with my own hand, as the rest of the sculpture works well as can be seen in the GIF below. I am planning to improve this sculpture next week by using 3D printer parts. I hope to replace the gears and fixtures with some that are more reliable and sturdy.
