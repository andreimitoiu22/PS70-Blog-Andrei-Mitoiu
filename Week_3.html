This was the initial plan. As seen in [Sophie's flock of birds](https://sophiecwebster.github.io/PHYSCI-70/03_kinetic/index.html), I wanted to create a system that transformed rotational motion into linear motion using wires that are bent in the right way. 
My plan was to immitate the movement in a "wack a mole" game, in which moles randomly come out of the ground. Unfortunately, I knew I couldn't immitate the randomness, so I wanted to just have them come up and down one after the other.
I knew I would mainly use laser cut wood (for the gears) and cardboard.
