## About Me

My name is Andrei Mitoiu, and I am a freshman here at Harvard. My main area of interest is Filmmaking, and I hope to pursue a concentration in Art, Film and Visual Studies. Throughout high school, I had the opportunity to study Computer Science, and learned the basics of programming through Python. Through this course, I hope to combine these two fields by discovering and creating new tools that can enhance and aid my filmmaking process on a high technical level.
